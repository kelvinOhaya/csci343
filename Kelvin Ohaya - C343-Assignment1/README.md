<img src="https://docs.csgrader.org/files/readme/LinkedList.svg" height="auto" width="auto" style="border-radius:3%">

**Before you start**: Make sure you right-click the CMakeLists.txt file in root directory and load CMake Project.

Complete the Sequence class in the /src directory using C++ pointers. 

**_You must use pointers for this assignment._**

### Boundary Conditions To Consider

1. What happens in the add and remove methods if the position is out of bounds?

2. What is the length of an empty sequence?

3. What is the outcome of entry function if the position is out of bounds?

4. What is the outcome of clear function if Sequence is already empty?

## Required Tasks
To complete this assignment you must do the following:

- There should be at least three tests total for each test file.
- [Have all tests pass and code coverage is 80%](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/running-test-with-coverage.html#run-config-with-coverage).

  
**Note:** When you add a test file you will need to add the path to the add_executable(...) macro 
in the test\CMAkeLists.txt file.
